# Optimizing State Updates for Performance and Re-rendering in React
Welcome to the Optimizing State Updates for Performance and Re-rendering in React repository! This project contains code examples, best practices, and advanced patterns discussed in the [LinkedIn article](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/optimizing-state-updates-performance-re-rendering-react-jon-howard-tn0xe/) aimed at optimizing React applications by reducing unnecessary re-renders and improving overall performance.

## üìö Overview

In modern React applications, performance optimization is key to maintaining smooth and responsive user interfaces, especially in larger apps with complex state management. This repository demonstrates effective techniques to enhance performance, including:

- **Memoization with `React.memo`** to prevent unnecessary component re-renders.
- **Function memoization with `useCallback`** for stable function references.
- **Memoizing calculations with `useMemo`** to avoid recalculating values on every render.
- **State management best practices** to ensure efficient data handling without bloating state unnecessarily.

All examples are written in **TypeScript** to ensure type safety and clarity.

## üõ† Key Concepts & Examples

Each optimization technique is covered with a dedicated example file. Here‚Äôs a breakdown of what you‚Äôll find:

### 1. `React.memo` for Pure Components
**Example file**: `react-memo-for-pure-components.tsx`

This example shows how to use `React.memo` to prevent components from re-rendering when props remain unchanged, optimizing pure functional components for performance.

### 2. Function Memoization with `useCallback`
**Example file**: `using-use-callback-for-event-handlers.tsx`

`useCallback` helps stabilize function references, particularly useful when passing functions as props to child components. This reduces the risk of child components re-rendering unnecessarily.

### 3. Expensive Calculations with `useMemo`
**Example file**: `using-use-memo-to-cache-expensive-calculations.tsx`

This example demonstrates how `useMemo` can cache expensive calculations, preventing them from running on every render. Ideal for scenarios with computationally intensive tasks.
